## How does Wizdesk work? 

### Support and Admin Users

**Who are support users?** <br>

**Who are organisation specific support users and what does it mean to Wizdesk?** <br>
- These are users who have certain organisations assigned to them. 
- They get notified when a customer creates a ticket or imports tickets.
- They also get notified when anyone comments or changes the status of a ticket that is assigned to them.

### 1. **Authentication**

#### 1.1 Sign Up and Log In

1. Using google OAuth you can both signup and login at the same time i.e if you are a first time user you will be both signed up and logged in if not then you will be logged in.

after which you can use this password to login without using google OAuth.
