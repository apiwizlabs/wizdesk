## üöÄ Getting Started
This is the backend code for [Wizdesk](../), <- Click here to go to UI setup  

### ‚ú® PreRequisites


1. You will need to setup a private aws bucket.
    - save the access key, secret key, region names and bucket names. these need to be updated in the config and env as given in the following sections.
2. Generate a RSA public and private key pair using this [website](https://cryptotools.net/rsagen).
3. Enable google oauth for your dns/localhost url. here are the [docs](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en)
4. Enable an existing/new gmail to be used with nodemailer to send email alerts and invites. follow this [blog](https://miracleio.me/snippets/use-gmail-with-nodemailer).
    - the password generated after following the blog will be referred to as "generated email password"
5. Generate a string of your choice to be used as a JWT Secret.   
6. Create a mongodb database and replace the url in the place of <mongo_db_url>

Create a .env file and update the following variables accordingly.

```javascript
PRIVATE_KEY: "< place the generated RSA private key here ( refer to the 2nd point ) >"
JWT_SECRET: "< place a randomly generated string (refer to the 5th point above)  >"
AWS_ACCESSKEY: "< place the AWS Access Key ( refer to the 1st point above ) >"
AWS_SECRET_KEY: "< place the AWS Secret Key ( refer to the 1st point above ) >"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: "< place the Google Client Id ( refer to the 3rd point above ) >"
ADMIN_EMAIL: "<optionally you can add admin email in the env >"
ADMIN_PASSWORD: "<optionally you can add admin email in the env >"
```

Navigate to the `./config.js` and update the following variables accordingly

```javascript
{
    DB_URL: "< place your mongo db url (refer to the 6th point above) >",
    NODE_ENV: "development",
    PORT: 3002,
    
    AWS_BUCKET_NAME: "<place aws bucket name ( refer to the 1st point above )>",
    AWS_REGION: "<place aws bucket region ( refer to the 1st point above )>",
     
    TOKEN_EXPIRY: "24h", // expiry time for login token
    INVITE_EXPIRY: "1h", // invite link expiry
    RESET_EXPIRY: "300000", // reset password link expiry 5mins,
    MAIL_HOST:"smtp.gmail.com",
    MAIL_PORT:"587",
    MAIL_USER:"< Mail id used to generate below password >",
    MAIL_PASSWORD:"< generated email password (refer to 4th point) >",
    MAIL_FROM:"< Same as MAIL USER >",
    BASE_URL: "http://localhost:3000/"
    ADMIN_EMAIL: "< Dummy admin email of your choice >",
    ADMIN_PASSWORD: "< admin email password string of your choice >",
}
```

Insert a admin user document to your local db:

generate a hashed password for the admin user and insert it as a value for the "password" key.  <br />
Optionally you can save your admin user password in the config or .env file of your choice.

```
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "64114ad83d4089dedf268d44"
  },
  "name": "Admin",
  "email": <dummy admin email of your choice>,
  "password": <generated hashed password>,
  "type": "ADMIN USER",
  "lastLogin": {
    "$date": "2023-07-11T09:51:59.075Z"
  },
  "cts": {
    "$date": "2023-03-15T04:34:32.566Z"
  },
  "mts": {
    "$date": "2023-07-11T09:51:59.075Z"
  },
  "__v": 0,
  "isLocked": false,
  "assignedOrganisations": [],
  "isDeleted": false
}
```

This should start the server, database and populate dummy data in the database to get started. <br />
